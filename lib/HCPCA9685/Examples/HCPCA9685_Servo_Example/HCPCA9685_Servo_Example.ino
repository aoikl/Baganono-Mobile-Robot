10/06/16 version 0.1: Original version


This example demonstrates how to use the HCPCA9685 library together with the PCA9685
to control up to 16 servos. The sketch will initialise the library putting it into
'servo mode' and then will continuously sweep one servo connected to PWM output 0
back and forth. The example has been written particularly for the 16 Channel 12-bit
PWM Servo Motor Driver Module (HCMODU0097) available from hobbycomponents.com

To use the module connect it to your Arduino as follows:

PCA9685...........Uno/Nano
GND...............GND
OE................N/A
SCL...............A5
SDA...............A4
VCC...............5V

External 5V Power for the servo(s) can be supplied by the V+ and GND input of the
screw terminal block.

PLEASE NOTE: Depending on your servo it is possible for this sketch to attempt
drive the servo beyond its end stops. If your servo is hitting its end stops then
you should adjust the the min and max values in this sketch.
